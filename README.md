# TO-DO App
This TO-DO App provides users with a simple design that allows them to handle their daily tasks with ease! With an easy-to-use UI, users may-
* check their tasks to complete them,
* remove them by long pressing on them,
* review their completed and deleted tasks through the side panel and
* restore or permanently delete tasks that were previously marked as 'completed' or 'deleted'.

This code and its implementation are my own, and no one else may use it without my consent.
